# MNIST
This repo runs the `tensorflow-keras` example for a simple convnet that does 'MNIST classification' and originated from 'https://keras.io/examples/vision/mnist_convnet/'.

Couple convolutional neural network models, i.e., bigger, smaller, and medium sized ones, are trained; the loss and accuracy plots are displayed.
Finally, some of the weights of the first layer of the medium sized model is displayed.
