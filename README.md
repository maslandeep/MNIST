# MNIST
This repo runs the `tensorflow-keras` example for a simple convnet that does `MNIST classification` and originated from https://keras.io/examples/vision/mnist_convnet/.

How to run:
1) Open your `colab` in your browser and click `Github`.
2) Copy and paste the link to the search box: `https://github.com/maslandeep/MNIST/tree/main/examples/vision/ipynb`.
3) Click the appeared `.ipynb` link.

What is there:
1) Three variatons of convolutional neural network, i.e., `bigger`, `smaller`, and `medium` sized ones, are trained; the `loss` and `accuracy` plots are displayed.
2) Finally, some of the `weights` of the first layer of the medium sized model are `visualized`.
